      <p>
        Domestic-violence cases in Florida move fast and the stakes are
        extraordinary. A protective injunction can affect where you live,
        whether you see your children, whether you can possess firearms,
        and your immigration, employment, and professional licensing status
        &mdash; sometimes permanently. Whether you need protection or are
        defending against allegations, you should have experienced family-
        law counsel from the first hearing.
      </p>

      <h2>The Five Types of Florida Injunctions</h2>
      <p>
        Florida law provides five distinct protective injunctions, each
        with its own elements and procedure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Domestic violence injunction</strong> (§741.30) &mdash;
          between spouses, former spouses, people related by blood or
          marriage, people who have a child in common, or people who
          currently or formerly lived together as a family.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dating violence injunction</strong> (§784.046) &mdash;
          between people in a significant romantic relationship within the
          prior 6 months.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sexual violence injunction</strong> (§784.046) &mdash;
          regardless of the relationship between the parties, when there
          has been a qualifying sexual offense.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Repeat violence injunction</strong> (§784.046) &mdash;
          two incidents of violence or stalking within 6 months, with at
          least one incident within the prior 6 months.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stalking injunction</strong> (§784.0485) &mdash; a
          course of harassment or cyberstalking.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How the Process Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Petition.</strong> The petitioner files a sworn petition
          in the circuit court describing the specific acts justifying an
          injunction. No filing fee is charged for a §741.30 petition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Temporary (Ex Parte) Injunction.</strong> If the petition
          shows an immediate and present danger, the judge can issue a
          temporary injunction the same day, without the respondent
          present. It remains in place for up to 15 days.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Service.</strong> The respondent is served by a deputy
          and ordered to appear at the full hearing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Full Hearing.</strong> Usually within 15 days of the
          temporary order. Both sides present evidence and witnesses. The
          judge decides whether a <em>final</em> injunction will issue and,
          if so, for how long.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Final Injunction.</strong> The final injunction can be
          in place for a set duration or indefinitely, subject to later
          motions to modify or dissolve.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What an Injunction Can Do</h2>
      <p>A Florida injunction for protection can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prohibit all contact between the parties (in person, phone, text, social media, through third parties)</li>
        <li>Exclude the respondent from a shared residence</li>
        <li>Establish temporary time-sharing for shared children</li>
        <li>Award temporary exclusive use of a shared vehicle</li>
        <li>Order child support and/or spousal support on a temporary basis</li>
        <li>Require the respondent to surrender firearms and ammunition</li>
        <li>Order the respondent to complete a Batterers&apos; Intervention Program or substance-abuse treatment</li>
        <li>Award temporary attorney&apos;s fees</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Collateral Consequences</h2>
      <p>
        Even a civil injunction carries consequences that often surprise
        respondents:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Federal firearms prohibition</strong> under 18 U.S.C.
          §922(g)(8) &mdash; possessing any firearm or ammunition while
          subject to a qualifying injunction is a federal felony.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Immigration consequences</strong> for non-citizens,
          including grounds for removal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security-clearance review</strong> for military,
          defense-contractor, and federal-employee respondents.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Professional licensure</strong> issues for nurses,
          teachers, attorneys, and others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Employment</strong> &mdash; many employers run background
          checks that will show an active injunction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Housing</strong> &mdash; landlords conducting
          background checks may refuse to rent.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>If You Are Seeking Protection</h2>
      <p>
        I will help you file the petition, assemble corroborating evidence
        (photos, medical records, text messages, witness statements, police
        reports), and testify effectively at the final hearing. In parallel,
        if you are filing for divorce or paternity, I can coordinate the
        injunction with the broader family-law case so that time-sharing
        and support are addressed properly.
      </p>

      <h2>If You Are Defending Against Allegations</h2>
      <p>
        Not every petition describes what actually happened. Some
        petitions are weaponized in anticipation of divorce or custody
        litigation to create leverage. A weak or exaggerated petition,
        properly challenged, should be denied. I will:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Review the petition for statutory sufficiency</li>
        <li>Gather your text messages, call logs, and witness statements</li>
        <li>Prepare you for direct examination and cross</li>
        <li>Cross-examine the petitioner at the final hearing</li>
        <li>File motions to modify or dissolve if an injunction is entered based on incomplete evidence</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Violations of an Injunction</h2>
      <p>
        A violation of an injunction is a <strong>first-degree misdemeanor</strong>
        (or higher on subsequent violations). Violations carry immediate
        arrest and additional criminal charges. Because even inadvertent
        contact can violate an injunction, respondents need clear
        guidance on what they can and cannot do.
