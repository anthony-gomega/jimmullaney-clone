                  There is no doubt that your family-law dispute can cause a
                  great deal of stress. Very often, clients face a complete
                  change to their lifestyle. Because I have practiced
                  exclusively as a family-law attorney for more than twenty-five
                  years, I&apos;ve seen how these cases affect clients &mdash;
                  and I will make sure you are not overwhelmed by the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As an experienced divorce lawyer in Jacksonville, I am aware
                  of the emotional toll these cases take on clients and their
                  children. My goal is to help clients complete a smooth
                  transition to the next stage of their lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In many cases, the most stress comes from the duration of
                  the case. If possible, I look for ways to resolve cases.
                  Costly litigation is the last option. <strong>Always</strong>.
                  Experience has shown me that quicker settlements make for
                  happier clients. However, if a settlement is not possible, I
                  can take your case to court.
                </p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>
                  I was born and raised in Jacksonville. I graduated from
                  Wolfson High School in 1985. I attended the University of
                  Florida and received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1990.
                  After graduate school at the University of Central Florida, I
                  graduated from Cumberland School of Law at Samford
                  University. In 1996, I returned to Jacksonville, where I have
                  been practicing law ever since. In 2000, I started my own
                  practice focused exclusively on family law.
                </p>

                <h2>Where I Practice</h2>
                <p>
                  Unlike most Jacksonville family-law attorneys,{" "}
                  <strong>I am also licensed to practice law in Georgia</strong>.
                  My practice takes me to <strong>Duval</strong>,{" "}
                  <strong>Clay</strong>, <strong>St. Johns</strong>,{" "}
                  <strong>Nassau</strong>, <strong>Ware</strong>,{" "}
                  <strong>Charlton</strong>, and <strong>Camden</strong>{" "}
                  counties. With video conferencing I can appear in almost
                  any Florida county just as easily as in Duval.
                </p>
