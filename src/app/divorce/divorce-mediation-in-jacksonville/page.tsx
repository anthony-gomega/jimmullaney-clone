      <p>
        Mediation is a structured negotiation process in which a neutral
        third party &mdash; the mediator &mdash; helps divorcing spouses
        reach agreement on the issues in their case. I am a Florida Supreme
        Court&ndash;certified family court mediator, and mediation is one of
        the two main focuses of my Jacksonville practice. I can serve as
        your neutral mediator, or I can represent you as an advocate in
        mediation with a different mediator.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Mediation Is Usually the Right First Step</h2>
      <p>
        Florida courts require most family-law cases to attend mediation
        before trial. There is a reason for that requirement: mediation
        works. Nationally, 70 to 80 percent of family-law mediations result
        in a complete or partial settlement. Even when mediation does not
        fully resolve a case, it almost always narrows the issues and saves
        money at trial.
      </p>

      <p>The benefits, compared to contested litigation, are substantial:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Cost:</strong> A full-day mediation typically costs each
          party a few hundred to a few thousand dollars &mdash; a fraction
          of what contested litigation costs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Speed:</strong> Mediation can be scheduled within weeks
          and wraps up in a single day or two. Contested cases drag on for
          a year or more.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Privacy:</strong> Mediation communications are
          confidential under Florida Statutes §44.405. Nothing said in
          mediation can be used against you later.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Control:</strong> You and your spouse make the decisions.
          If you cannot agree in mediation, a judge who knows almost
          nothing about your family will decide for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Relationships:</strong> Especially important for
          co-parents, mediation preserves the ability to communicate after
          the case closes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flexibility:</strong> Mediated agreements can include
          creative, tailored solutions a judge cannot order.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Issues Mediation Can Address</h2>
      <p>
        Essentially any issue that can be decided by a family-law court can
        be resolved in mediation:

      </ul>

      <h2>How a Mediation Session Works</h2>
      <p>
        A typical Jacksonville family-law mediation runs half a day to a
        full day. Each side and their attorney (if represented) work in
        separate rooms. The mediator shuttles back and forth, exploring
        positions, identifying priorities, and helping each side understand
        the other&apos;s concerns. When agreement is reached, the mediator
        drafts a Mediated Settlement Agreement that both parties sign. The
        agreement is filed with the court and made part of the final
        judgment.
      </p>

      <h2>Mediation Before Litigation Even Starts</h2>
      <p>
        You do not need to have a pending court case to mediate. I
        frequently help couples mediate and finalize their divorce without
        ever filing a contested petition &mdash; effectively turning what
        might have been a contested case into an{" "}
        <Link href="/divorce/uncontested-divorce-in-jacksonville-fl">
          uncontested divorce
        </Link>
        . This is the fastest, cheapest, and least stressful route for
        families who think they might have disagreements but are willing to
        try to resolve them with help.
      </p>

      <h2>Collaborative Divorce: A Related Alternative</h2>
      <p>

        need more than a one-day mediation,{" "}

        offers a more comprehensive team-based approach.
