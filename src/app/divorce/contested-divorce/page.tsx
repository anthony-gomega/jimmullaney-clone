      <p>
        A contested divorce is any dissolution where the spouses cannot
        agree on one or more issues &mdash; property division, alimony,
        child support, time-sharing, valuation of a business, or who gets
        the house. When the parties cannot reach agreement themselves or in
        mediation, a judge decides. Contested divorces are longer, more
        expensive, and harder on everyone involved, so I always look for
        settlement opportunities first &mdash; but when litigation is
        necessary, I have the trial experience to protect your interests.
      </p>

      <h2>The Contested Divorce Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Petition for Dissolution of Marriage.</strong> The
          petitioner files and has the other spouse served.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Answer &amp; Counter-Petition.</strong> The responding
          spouse files an Answer and often a Counter-Petition setting out
          their own requests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mandatory Disclosure.</strong> Each spouse must exchange
          a sworn financial affidavit and the documents required by Florida
          Family Law Rule 12.285 &mdash; tax returns, pay stubs, bank
          statements, retirement statements, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Discovery.</strong> Interrogatories, requests for
          production, requests for admission, subpoenas to third parties,
          and depositions of the other spouse, financial experts, and
          custody evaluators as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Temporary Relief.</strong> Either party can ask the court
          for temporary orders on support, exclusive use of the home, and
          a temporary parenting schedule while the case is pending.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mediation.</strong> Florida courts require mediation in
          most contested family-law cases before trial. Mediation settles
          a substantial majority of cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pretrial Motions &amp; Case Management.</strong> The
          judge sets deadlines, resolves discovery disputes, and narrows
          issues for trial.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trial.</strong> Bench trial (no jury) before a family
          court judge. Testimony, exhibits, and closing arguments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Final Judgment.</strong> The judge issues a written
          ruling resolving every issue.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>How to Keep a Contested Case Under Control</h2>
      <p>
        The biggest mistake I see in contested divorce is letting the case
        run on reflex &mdash; responding to every motion, taking every
        deposition, fighting over every issue regardless of cost. A
        disciplined contested-divorce strategy:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify the handful of issues that actually matter and are actually contested.</li>
        <li>Invest in the evidence that moves those issues &mdash; not in discovery that produces nothing useful.</li>
        <li>Keep settlement conversations going in parallel with litigation, because most cases settle before trial anyway.</li>
        <li>Be realistic about outcomes. Judges have broad discretion in family law. Pushing for a result no reasonable judge will order is expensive and counter-productive.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Choose an Experienced Trial Advocate</h2>
      <p>
        I have handled Florida family-law litigation for over 25 years in
        Duval, Clay, St. Johns, Nassau, and the southern Georgia counties.
        I know the judges, the local rules, and what evidence actually
        carries weight at trial. I also know the limits of litigation
        &mdash; and I will tell you honestly when the right move is to
        settle rather than fight.
