      <p>
        Alimony &mdash; also called spousal support &mdash; is a payment from
        one spouse to the other after a divorce. In Florida, alimony exists to
        help a lower-earning or non-earning spouse transition from married to
        single life, and, in longer marriages, to allow both spouses to
        maintain a reasonably similar standard of living. Florida&apos;s
        alimony statute was substantially rewritten in 2023, and the new
        framework affects every alimony case filed since.
      </p>

      <h2>The 2023 Florida Alimony Reform</h2>
      <p>Effective July 1, 2023, Florida made three major changes to its alimony law:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Permanent alimony is abolished.</strong> Florida judges can
          no longer award permanent alimony in cases filed after the
          effective date. Long-term support now takes the form of
          <em> durational</em> alimony with a maximum length tied to the
          length of the marriage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Retirement becomes a ground to modify or terminate.</strong>{" "}
          A paying spouse who reaches normal retirement age may petition the
          court to reduce or terminate alimony.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Length caps on durational alimony.</strong> Short
          (under 10-year), moderate (10&ndash;20-year), and long
          (20+-year) marriages each have statutory limits on how long
          durational alimony can last.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Types of Alimony in Florida</h2>
      <p>After the 2023 reform, Florida recognizes four types of alimony:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Temporary alimony</strong> &mdash; support while the divorce
          is pending. Ends when the final judgment is entered.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bridge-the-gap alimony</strong> &mdash; short-term support
          (maximum 2 years) designed to help a spouse transition to being
          single. Cannot be modified once ordered.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rehabilitative alimony</strong> &mdash; time-limited
          support that allows a spouse to complete education, training, or
          re-enter the workforce. A specific rehabilitation plan is required.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Durational alimony</strong> &mdash; post-reform replacement
          for permanent alimony. Can last up to 50% of the length of a short
          marriage, 60% of a moderate marriage, and 75% of a long marriage,
          with statutory exceptions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Courts Consider</h2>
      <p>
        Florida judges analyze a detailed list of statutory factors to decide
        both whether to award alimony and how much:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The standard of living established during the marriage</li>
        <li>The length of the marriage (short, moderate, or long)</li>
        <li>Each spouse&apos;s age and physical/emotional condition</li>
        <li>Financial resources, including marital and non-marital assets</li>
        <li>Earning capacity, education, vocational skills, and employability</li>
        <li>Contributions to the marriage &mdash; homemaking, child-rearing, and support of the other spouse&apos;s career</li>
        <li>Tax treatment of the alimony award</li>
        <li>All sources of income actually or potentially available</li>
        <li>Responsibilities each spouse will have with respect to minor children</li>
        <li>Adultery, only to the extent it involves the dissipation of marital assets</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Amounts Are Calculated</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike child support, Florida alimony is not calculated by a rigid
        formula. Instead, judges conduct a two-step analysis: first, does the
        recipient have a <strong>need</strong>? Second, does the payor have
        the <strong>ability to pay</strong>? The amount awarded is what is
        reasonable considering the statutory factors, capped by what the
        payor can actually afford after their own reasonable expenses and any
        child support obligation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interplay with child support matters a great deal. Alimony
        received is taxable income to the recipient for child-support
        purposes. See our{" "}
        <Link href="/florida-child-support-calculator">
          free child support calculator
        </Link>{" "}
        to model how an alimony number changes the support picture.
      </p>

      <h2>Modifying an Existing Alimony Order</h2>
      <p>
        Alimony can generally be modified when there is a substantial,
        material, and unanticipated change in circumstances &mdash; job loss,
        disability, retirement, a recipient&apos;s remarriage, or a supportive
        relationship. The exception is bridge-the-gap alimony, which cannot
        be modified.{" "}

      </p>

      <h2>Cohabitation and &ldquo;Supportive Relationships&rdquo;</h2>
      <p>
        Florida law allows a court to reduce or terminate alimony if the
        recipient is in a &ldquo;supportive relationship&rdquo; with someone
        &mdash; living together, combining finances, sharing expenses &mdash;
        even without remarriage. Proving or defending against a supportive
        relationship is fact-intensive and often contested.
      </p>
